Detailed Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This class provides a standard synchronous interface for reading from
and writing to files or devices.

All the methods of this class are mapped directly to underlying Operating
System API (not to the C-runtime library). A typical sequence of steps when
working with a file usually looks like this:

* Open a file with ``open`` method;
* Read from the file using ``read`` method;
* Write to the file using ``write`` method;
* Close the file with ``close`` method.

It's recommended to use disposable pattern when working with local file
variables. Whether or not to use exception semantics or a traditional error
code depends on what deems to be more convenient in each particular case.

.. rubric:: Sample code:

.. ref-code-block::

    foo (void const* data)
    {
        disposable io.File file;
        file.open ("data.txt");
        file.write (data, dynamic sizeof (data));
        // ...

    catch:
        // handle the error
    } // file will be closed no matter how we leave the function

`io.FileStream`, `io.MappedFile`

Fields
------

.. _doxid-struct_member_io_file_iface_m_isopen:
.. _cid-io.file.m_isopen:
.. ref-code-block:: jancy
	:class: title-code-block

	bool readonly m_isOpen

Holds the open status for the file, i.e. ``true`` if opened; ``false``
otherwise.

Properties
----------

.. _doxid-property_io_file_m_size:
.. _cid-io.file.m_size:
.. ref-code-block:: jancy
	:class: title-code-block

	:ref:`uint64_t<doxid-typedef_uint64_t>` const property m_size 

This property is used for getting and setting file size.

Reading from this property returns current size of the file; writing to
it sets new size [#f3]_.

.. _doxid-property_io_file_m_position:
.. _cid-io.file.m_position:
.. ref-code-block:: jancy
	:class: title-code-block

	:ref:`uint64_t<doxid-typedef_uint64_t>` property m_position 

This property is used for getting and setting [#f3]_ current file
position, i.e. the offset at which file contents will be accessed by
``read`` and ``write`` methods.

Accessing this property for sequential devices (which do not support
access at random-offset) likely results in exception being thrown
(unless the underlying OS silently ignores position read/write and does
not return any IO error).

Methods
-------

.. _doxid-function_io_file_open:
.. _cid-io.file.open:
.. ref-code-block:: jancy
	:class: title-code-block

	bool errorcode open (
	    char const* name,
	    :ref:`io.FileOpenFlags<doxid-type_io_fileopenflags>` flags = 0
	    )

Opens or creates a file or device.

The function accepts two arguments. The first one, ``name`` specifies
the name of the file/device. The second one, ``flags``, can be used to
specify open options. Check `io.FileOpenFlags` for the complete list of
options.

Returns ``true`` on success. If file or device could not be opened, IO
error supplied by operating system is set and then the function returns
``false`` [#f1]_.

.. _doxid-function_io_file_close:
.. _cid-io.file.close:
.. ref-code-block:: jancy
	:class: title-code-block

	void close ()

Closes a previously opened file, does nothing if the file is not opened.
This function always succeeds.

Sometimes it may be convenient to use *disposable* pattern to ensure
timely invokation of ``close`` [#f2]_.

.. _doxid-function_io_file_read:
.. _cid-io.file.read:
.. ref-code-block:: jancy
	:class: title-code-block

	:ref:`size_t<doxid-typedef_size_t>` errorcode read (
	    void* p,
	    :ref:`size_t<doxid-typedef_size_t>` size
	    )

Attempts to read up to ``size`` bytes from file into the buffer pointed
to by ``p``.

Returns the actual amount of bytes read or ``-1`` if error occurs.

If read operation is unsuccessful, IO error supplied by the operating
system is set and then the function returns ``-1`` [#f1]_.

If this function is called when there is no incoming data on the opened
device, it blocks until either the data arrives, or the file is closed.

.. _doxid-function_io_file_write:
.. _cid-io.file.write:
.. ref-code-block:: jancy
	:class: title-code-block

	:ref:`size_t<doxid-typedef_size_t>` errorcode write (
	    void const* p,
	    :ref:`size_t<doxid-typedef_size_t>` size
	    )

Attempts to write ``size`` bytes from the buffer pointed to by ``p``
into the file.

Returns the actual amount of bytes written on success. If write
operation is unsuccessful, IO error supplied by the operating system is
set and then the function returns ``-1`` [#f1]_.

Aliases
-------

.. _doxid-alias_io_file_dispose:
.. _cid-io.file.dispose:
.. ref-code-block:: jancy
	:class: title-code-block

	alias dispose = close

Effectively makes ``io.File`` a *disposable* class [#f2]_.
