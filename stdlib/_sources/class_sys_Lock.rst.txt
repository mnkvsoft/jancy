Detailed Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This class is used to ensure exclusive access to some shared
resource.

Only one thread at a time can *acquire* the ``sys.Lock`` object and hence,
get exclusive access to some resource this ``sys.Lock`` object is being a
guardian of. To do that, a thread calls ``lock`` method. Once it returns,
the ``sys.Lock`` object is in *locked* state and this thread can exclusively
access the associated resource.

Any other thread trying to *acquire* it will wait until the original thread
*releases* the lock with ``unlock`` method.

Code sample::

    import "sys_Lock.jnc"

    sys.Lock g_event;
    int g_resource;

    thread1 ()
    {
        // ...

        g_lock.lock ();   // acquire the lock
        g_resource++;     // we can safely access the resource now
        g_lock.unlock (); // let others get access, too

        // continue...
    }

    thread2 ()
    {
        // ...

        g_lock.lock ();   // acquire the lock
        g_resource--;     // we can safely access the resource now
        g_lock.unlock (); // let others get access, too

        // continue...
    }

Methods
-------

.. _doxid-function_sys_lock_lock:
.. _cid-sys.lock.lock:
.. ref-code-block:: jancy
	:class: title-code-block

	void lock ()

*Acquires* the lock. If the lock is already acquired by another thread,
the current thread enters the wait queue for the lock. When the lock is
released by other thread(s), the current thread acquires it.

.. _doxid-function_sys_lock_unlock:
.. _cid-sys.lock.unlock:
.. ref-code-block:: jancy
	:class: title-code-block

	void unlock ()

*Releases* the lock. If other threads are waiting for the lock at the
moment, the first one in the wait queue *acquires* the lock.
